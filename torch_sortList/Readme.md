## How a sorted list can be identified with some multiplication instead of if-else!?

This is a simple and funny model on PyTorch to understand how we can work with it.
The model will be trained on list of numbers which can be sorted or not, afterwards, the model can predict the list is sorted or not. In a regular way, this is from O(n) and can be simply done by a loop and if-else. Here, a sorted list can be spoted by some multiplications!
